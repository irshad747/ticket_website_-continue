@features by Irshad (The Dark Knight) with user stories
Feature 1: Ticket Status Tracking
As a student, I want to check the status of my support ticket (e.g., open, in progress, closed) so that I know whether my query is being addressed and what to expect next.

As a support team member, I need to update the status of tickets as they progress so that students are kept informed about their queries.

Feature 2: Priority Tagging System
As a support team member, I want to tag tickets with different priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) based on the query's urgency so that we can manage our workload more effectively and respond to critical issues faster.

As a student, I want my urgent issues to be recognized and addressed quickly so that it does not impact my studies.

 Feature 3: Feedback System for Support Responses
As a student, after my ticket has been resolved, I want to provide feedback on the support I received so that the support team can improve their service.

As a support team leader, I want to review feedback from students to identify areas for training and improving our support processes.

Feature 4: Personalized User Dashboard
As a student, I want a personalized dashboard where I can view my past tickets, their statuses, and any relevant announcements or updates so that I have all my support-related information in one place.

As a support team member, I want to view tickets assigned to me, their priorities, and statuses on my dashboard so that I can efficiently manage my workload.
